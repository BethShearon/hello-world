Intro
GitHub was just getting started when I was at university for E-Commerce and Computer Science, & evidently it's a thing now, go GitHub.  I taught myself HTML in 1995.  I'm in Oklahoma now, by way of south Florida and Michigan some time ago... the plan was to head to Austin after Oklahoma but I wound up raising babies instead.  Thank goodness that's overwith lol
