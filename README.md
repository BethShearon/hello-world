## Intro  
GitHub was just getting started when I was at university for E-Commerce and Computer Science, & evidently it's a thing now, == go GitHub! ==  
  The markdown cheat sheet says the double equals is supposed to signal a highlight.  So much for going by rules?  
. 
I taught myself HTML in 1995 so there have been a few changes lol but one thing that's been pretty consistent is try it out and see what happens, didn't work, try this instead...  
. 
I'm in Oklahoma now, by way of south Florida and Michigan some time ago... the plan was to head to Austin after Oklahoma but I wound up raising babies instead.  (They are grown now, turned out to be quite the pitstop.)  Turns out I like the hills and trees and am no longer feeling the urge to get to the desert.
