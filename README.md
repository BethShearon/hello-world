## Intro  
GitHub was just getting started when I was at university for E-Commerce and Computer Science, & evidently it's a thing now, ==go GitHub!==  I taught myself HTML in 1995 so there have been a few changes lol.  I'm in Oklahoma now, by way of south Florida and Michigan some time ago... the plan was to head to Austin after Oklahoma but I wound up raising babies instead.  (They are grown now.)
